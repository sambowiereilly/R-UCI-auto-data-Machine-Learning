Purpose:
Can MPG can be predicted using only one attribute from a car, for 
example; displacement, horsepower, weight or acceleration? 
Aim to predict MPG as a function of one of these attributes by 
constructing linear models (of varying degree), bin smooth 
models (of varying knot positions) and b-spline models (of varying 
knots and degree of polynomial).

-----------------------------

Two key scripts for this project are located in the RScripts folder. 

driver_ModelCreationandPrediction.R
Contains all data analysis, exploration and uses functions within 
'func_ModelFunctions.R' script to create models and visualisations
All R packages used can be found here too.

func_ModelFunctions.R
Contains all personal functions developed for this project which 
generalise model creation and result visualisations.

Process flows and example output/results from different models can 
also be found in the 'Figures' folder.
